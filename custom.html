Now that you have built a game to my specifications, I'm going to give you an 
opportunity to make some changes to the code to allow you to 
personalize the game. You need to realize something very important at this 
point:</font></p>
<p align="center">
<b><font face="Tahoma" size="6" color="#FFFFFF">
<span style="background-color: #008080">TO COMPLETE THIS PROJECT, YOUR SIMPLE<br>
GAME FROM STEP 5 MUST PLAY CORRECTLY!</span></font></b></p>
<p>
<font face="Times New Roman">
If your Simple Game does not play correctly, you will need to fix it before you 
can complete the Custom Simple Game. Customizing the Simple Game will not only 
give you an opportunity to add a personal touch to your game, but will give you 
a chance to show that you understand what was going on with each part of the 
game as we were putting it together.</font></p>
<hr>
<p>
<b><font face="Times New Roman" size="5">CREATE A NEW COPY OF THE GAME FILE</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Let's start by creating a copy of your game.js 
file. We will use this new version of the file to make our changes. DO NOT CHANGE THE CODE OF YOUR game.js 
file. We want to keep a working version of our game.js file for two main 
reasons: so we can submit the original file to be graded, and so that we have a 
copy of the file that actually works in case we mess up our custom game file and 
need to start over.</font></p>
<ol>
<font face="Times New Roman">
  <li>Open the <b>game.js</b> file in a text editor</li>
  <li>Click File and then click Save As... (or whatever the equivalent is for 
	your chosen text editor)</li>
  <li>Go to your <b>SimpleGame</b> folder</li>
  <li>Name the file <b>game2.js</b> - note that you <i>MUST</i> type the name 
  out completely including the period and the js...<br>
<img border="0" src="pics/c01.jpg" width="344" height="72"></li>
  <li>Click <b>Save</b></li>
</font>
</ol>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Again, <b>DO NOT</b> save the changes in this 
Step to your game.js file. At the end of this Step, you should have <b>TWO</b> .js 
files - one named <b>game</b> and one named <b>game2</b> (note that you will 
need to submit both of them for grading).</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Trust me, someone will save the stuff from this 
step in their game.js file and I will take off a bunch of points and they will 
yell 'but why!?!' at me and I'll just point to <b> <font color="#008000">THIS</font>
<font color="#800080">SENTENCE</font> <font color="#808000">RIGHT</font>
<font color="#008080">HERE</font></b>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Don't let that person be you.</font></p>
<hr>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="5">REQUIRED CODE CHANGES</font></b></p>
<font face="Times New Roman">
<p>You are <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">REQUIRED</span> to make 5 
changes to the code, and then you are free to make additional changes if you 
wish. Follow the directions below to make the 5 required changes.</p>
<hr>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><span style="background-color: #000000"><b>REQUIRED CHANGE #1</b></span><b><span style="background-color: #000000">:</span></b></font> THE SIZE OF THE CANVAS</p>
<p>The height of the canvas is actually a pretty good size for this game, so we will only be changing the width of the canvas. Remember that you 
previously changed the canvas size all the way back in Step 1, so you will 
adjust the width this time the same way.</p>
<ol start="6">
  <li>Open the game2.js file in a text editor (<i><b>DO NOT</b></i> use the game.js 
  file)</li>
  <li>Locate the code that sets the width of the canvas, and change the value to 
  500 (yes, both the height and width should be 500)</li>
  <li>Save the game2.js file</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>REQUIRED 
CHANGE #</b></font></span><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><span style="background-color: #000000">2:</span></b></font> INSERT A NEW CHARACTER GRAPHIC</p>
<p>You must change the game character to another image. The new character you 
use is up to you. I have supplied you with you several images you can use if you 
wish (they are in the Additional Resources folder on Schoology, inside a folder 
called New Characters), or you can create your own game 
character for <b> <i><font color="#FF0000">extra credit</font></i></b>. Remember that 
your character must have 2 image states just like the angel image:</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="angel.png" width="65" height="190"></p>
<p>The easiest way to create your own image is to open the angel image in 
Photoshop (or some other image editor) and change it to look the way you want. 
Just be sure that your new characters are on top of each other just like the 
angel image. This way, you don't have to worry about matching the height and width of 
your image to that of the angel image.</p>
<ol start="9">
  <li>Either select the pre-made character image you would like to use from the 
  New Characters folder or create a new character yourself (how to create your 
  own character using image editing software is 
  beyond us at this point in the course, so you are on your own if you want to 
  use a custom character...that's why creating your own character is <i><font color="#FF0000">extra credit</font></i>)</li>
  <li>Save the image in your <b>SimpleGame</b> folder - you can name it whatever you 
  want, just don't name it <i>angel</i> as this will save over the original angel image</li>
  <li>Open the game2.js file in a text editor (<i><b>DO NOT</b></i> use the game.js 
  file)</li>
  <li>Change the name of the image in the code from angel.png to whatever you named 
  the image (Direction 4 of Step 2 shows you in the code where the image is 
  referenced)</li>
  <li>Save the game2.js file</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>REQUIRED 
CHANGE #</b></font></span><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><span style="background-color: #000000">3:</span></b></font> THE COLOR OF THE PLATFORMS</p>
<p>You must change the color of both platforms. You can make them any color you like, 
    just be sure that the super platforms are a different color than the 
    regular platforms. Remember that the game actually uses 2 colors for both 
types of platforms, which gives them a gradient appearance...</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="pics/c02.jpg" width="745" height="344"></p>
<p>Note that the 6 character codes that set the color are known as hex codes. For 
example, FF8C00 is the hex code for orange. Exactly how hex codes work will be 
covered later in the course, but for now just realize that every color has a 6 
character hex code associated with it that allows us to very specifically 
control what color a game is using. Since we won't go into depth about how hex 
codes work for a while, you can use
<a href="https://www.ginifab.com/feeds/pms/color_picker_from_image.php">this 
website</a> to look up the hex code for the color you wish to use. The website 
looks like this and is very easy to use:</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="pics/c03.jpg" width="752" height="408"></p>
<p align="left">Simply click on the color box that you wish you use 
(for example, in the above image I clicked on the upper-right, reddish color 
pointed at with the yellow arrow) 
and note that the hex code will be displayed to the right of the color boxes 
(the blue arrow above). Just place the code for the new color into 
the game file.</p>
<ol start="14">
  <li>Determine what new colors you wish to use - note that you can either keep 
  the gradients by using two colors for each platform, or if you wish you can make your 
  platforms a solid color by simply using the same hex code for both that.firstcolor and that.secondcolor 
  in the code</li>
  <li>Open the game2.js file in a text editor (<i><b>DO NOT</b></i> use the 
  game.js file)</li>
  <li>Change the color values to the new colors you wish to use</li>
  <li>Save the game2.js file</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>REQUIRED 
CHANGE #</b></font></span><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><span style="background-color: #000000">4:</span></b></font> THE NUMBER OF PLATFORMS</p>
<p>Since we have a wider canvas, we need more 
    platforms to help out the player. You can set this number to whatever 
    number you feel makes the game fun, but keep in mind that 
    too many platforms will make the game too easy, and too few platforms will 
    make the game unplayable. No matter what, the game must be playable!!</p>
<p>Since you are just starting out as a game creator, the perfect number of 
platforms may be difficult to estimate. The best way to find a number that you 
are happy with is to experiment until you have a number of platforms that you like.</p>
<ol start="18">
  <li>Open the game2.js file in a text editor (<i><b>DO NOT</b></i> use the 
  game.js file)</li>
  <li>Locate the code that controls how many platforms are in the game - I 
  am not going to tell you where this code is located, you'll have to find it 
  yourself</li>
  <li>Change the value to a number between 5 and 15 - DO NOT use numbers below 
  5, above 15, or the number 7 (which is the original value)<br>
  -- Anything below 5 will result in too few platforms and the game will be 
  unplayable - no matter what the game must be playable!!<br>
  -- Anything above 15 will result in too many platforms and the game could 
  literally play by itself because the character never has a chance to hit the 
  bottom</li>
  <li>Save the game2.js file</li>
</ol>
<p>When you finish making changes to your game later in this step and you have 
created a new webpage to hold your game, you can play 
it in the browser and determine if you like the number of platforms you have set 
or if you would like to change it.</p>
<hr>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>REQUIRED 
CHANGE #</b></font></span><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><span style="background-color: #000000">5:</span></b></font> THE GAME OVER MESSAGE</p>
<p>The current Game Over message is rather boring, so let's spice it up a bit. 
You can make the text say anything you like, just be sure it conveys that the 
game is over and that you are showing the player what their final score is. 
Also, the text must be <b>
<font color="#800080">school appropriate</font></b>. Seriously, don't make me 
write you up because you put something vulgar in your game.</p>
<ol start="22">
  <li>Open the game2.js file in a text editor (<i><b>DO NOT</b></i> use the 
  game.js file)</li>
  <li>Locate the code that controls the Game Over message</li>
  <li>Change the font to Comic Sans MS</li>
  <li>Change the color from black to red</li>
  <li>Save the game2.js file</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p><font size="5"><b>OPTIONAL</b></font><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="5"> 
CODE CHANGES</font></b></p>
<p>You <i>MUST</i> make the five changes indicated above, but to allow you to 
really customize your game to something that you like, you are free to make 
additional changes. Some things you may want to consider changing include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bounce height</li>
  <li>Gravity</li>
  <li>The speed of the platforms</li>
  <li>The size of the Game Over text</li>
  <li>The position of the Game Over text</li>
  <li>The shape of the clouds</li>
  <li>The color of the clouds</li>
  <li>The number of clouds</li>
  <li>The color of the sky (make sure the platforms, clouds,  
  character, and game over text can all be easily seen over the new sky color)</li>
  <li>The number of points awarded each time the screen scrolls</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that you DO NOT have to make any additional changes past the required 5 if you don't want 
to (and if you are pressed for time or actually behind right now, don't bother 
making any changes other then the required 5), this is just an opportunity for 
you to personalize the game if you wish.</p>
<ol start="22">
  <li>If you wish to make additional changes to your game2.js file, then open it in 
	a text editor (<i><b>DO NOT</b></i> use the 
  game.js file) and make whatever changes you want and then save the game2.js 
  file</li>
  <li>If you do not wish to make any additional changes past the required 5, 
  simply move on in these directions</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p><b><font size="5">CREATE NEW WEB PAGE</font></b></p>
<p>Now that your game2.js file is ready to go, we need create a new webpage for 
it to play in.</p>
<ol start="24">
  <li>Open the <b>index.html</b> file in a text editor</li>
  <li>Click File and then click Save As... (or whatever the equivalent command 
	is for your text editor)</li>
  <li>Go to your <b>SimpleGame</b> folder</li>
  <li>Name the file <b>index2.html</b> - note that you <i>MUST</i> type the name 
  out completely including the period and the html...<br>
<img border="0" src="pics/c04.jpg" width="301" height="77"></li>
  <li>Click <b>Save</b></li>
  <li>Look in the code and locate the reference to &quot;game.js&quot; 
  and change it to &quot;game2.js&quot; (this will cause the game2 
  file to load when we open the index2 webpage)</li>
  <li><b>Save</b> the file again (keep it named index2.html)</li>
</ol>
<p>Now we need to test our new game to make sure it works in the browser.</p>
<ol start="31">
  <li>Go to your <b>SimpleGame</b> folder</li>
  <li>Double-click the index2 file to open the page in a browser (note that if 
	the game does not automatically open in Chrome, you can simply open Chrome 
	and use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+O to bring up the Open window and then go 
	to your <b>SimpleGame</b> folder and double-click the index2 file and it 
	will open)</li>
	<li>Test the functionality of your game - the game's level of difficulty 
	should be similar to how the game played before you made any changes</li>
  <li>If any part of the game does not work correctly - or if you have too many 
  or too few platforms for the game to be playable - go into the code for the 
  game2.js file and <b>FIX THE PROBLEM</b></li>

<b><font size="5">EXTRA CREDIT</font></b></font></u></p>
</font>
<font face="Times New Roman">
<p>If you find yourself ahead of the rest of the class or want to do some work 
before or after school to get some extra credit, here is a simple addition you 
can make to your game. If you actually played the example game linked under the 
image at the top of Step 1, you might have noticed that the Game Over screen looks 
like this...</p>
<p align="center"><img src="pics/501.jpg" width="351" height="191"></p>
<p>While your Game Over screen looks like this...</p>
<p align="center"><img src="pics/502.jpg" width="351" height="191"></p>
<p>Your task to earn this extra credit is to add in code that not only displays  CLICK ANYWHERE TO PLAY 
AGAIN, but will actually restart the game when the player clicks on the canvas. 
Feel free to hop on the Internet to get some help with writing the correct code 
- just be sure that your game plays like it should and actually restarts when 
the user clicks on the canvas.</p>
<ol start="35">
  <li>Once your extra credit code has been inserted and your game works, save it 
  in your <b>SimpleGame</b> folder as game2.js</li>
